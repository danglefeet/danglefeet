Matt Baker  

Director of Data & Analytics | BI & Cloud Solutions Architect | Support & Operations Leader

I lead data, analytics, and support organizations with a focus on modernizing BI platforms, improving SLAs, and designing automation that brings order to complex environments. Over 16 years, I’ve supported enterprise organizations across Healthcare, Financial Services, Energy, and other industries—building and stabilizing analytics platforms, leading BI support teams, and delivering modernization initiatives in cloud and hybrid environments.

My GitHub includes practical tools and migration utilities that emerged directly from real-world BI, cloud, and integration challenges. These projects demonstrate my ability to work across legacy platforms, AWS services, and enterprise support ecosystems.
